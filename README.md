# rkheik's Blackbooks
Blackbooks(cheatsheets) for different langs & tools that I care about.

Each blackbook is designed as a reminder of basic/fun/cool/common used features of a lang or tool. It is not by any means an exhaustive list of features, when in doubt [RTFM!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM)
